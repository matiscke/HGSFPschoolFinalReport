\section*{Science Quiz}
This year we organized a Science Quiz as an additional social event.
Because this event was not in the program before the winter school, we regarded it as an additional, not mandatory event.
Still, all the students and speakers participated enthusiastically.
The participants formed teams and answered questions from diverse topics ranging from fun facts about science to recent Nobel prizes.
According to the survey and the atmosphere during the event the science quiz was a definitive success.
The quiz itself did not cause any additional costs in the budget, because the rooms were booked for us because of the lectures and the prizes were merchandising articles from research projects at Heidelberg University.
